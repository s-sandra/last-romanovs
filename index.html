                        <p>
                            In 2013, internet artist <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/" target="_blank">Darius Kazemi</a> decided to participate in National Novel Writing Month, but instead of writing a 
                            fifty-thousand word novel from scratch, he created a program to do it for him. Thus was born
                            <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/nanogenmo/novel-2.pdf" target="_blank">Teens Wander Around a House</a>, which he made by 
                            having AI agents wander through a simulation, narrate their actions and pull conversations from Twitter.
                            Kazemi's idea quickly caught on, and <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo</a> (National Novel 
                            Generation Month) continues as an annual event in November, where participants create programs that write fifty thousand word novels.
                            For six years, the coding celebration has brought together a community of artists and programmers from around the world, from beginners
                            to prolific creative coders such as 
                            <a href="https://nickm.com/" target="_blank">Nick Montfort</a>, 
                            <a href="https://lizadaly.com/" target="_blank">Liza Daly</a>,

                            and <a href="https://mewo2.com/" target="_blank">Martin O'Leary</a>.

                        <h1>How to Participate</h1>
                        <p>
                            NNGM moderators start reviewing entries on November 1 of each year, and accept them as late as the first week of 
                            December. To enter, simply open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo GitHub repository</a> 
                            for the current year (the 2020 repo will be available in November). Some create an issue declaring an intent to participate, others
                            use their issue as a dev diary, or to request help or feedback from the NNGM community. When your program is finished, 
                            place the link to your source code and a preview or description of your content as a comment in your issue. The rules are simple.
                            For an entry to be marked with a completed tag, the code must have been written in November and it must produce at least
                            fifty-thousand words.
                        </p>
                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <p>
                                Note that your NNGM source code does not have to be hosted on GitHub. Past entrants have placed their code in tweets 
                                (for Nano-NaNoGenMo, where the goal is to write a program under 250 characters), on their websites or in another hosting service, like
                                GitLab or Bitbucket.

                        <p>
                            The study of computer-generated literature, which frequently appropriates text from known sources, allows 
                            researchers to glean insight into the influences and mechanisms of contemporary language and question notions 
                            of authorship, creative expression and artificial intelligence. Looking at these works allows us to identify 
                            patterns and trends within entry genres and text generation methods.                          
                        </p>

                                One such trend is the use of literary classics as a 
                                foundation for generative novels - creators build upon themes and qualities of these works, often revealing new 
                                meanings within these familiar pieces through code and generative creativity.  Common works appropriated include 
                                <em>Moby Dick</em>, <em>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</em>, <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em>, and multiple versions of the Bible, 
                                along with the works of William Shakespeare, H.P. Lovecraft, and Jane Austen - particularly <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.  
                                NaNoGenMo participants also take inspiration in a wide variety of fields of study, from linguistics, culture, and 
                                music to geography, visual art, and computer science.

                                Other trends include common methods of generation which has led to the emergence and evolution of NaNoGenMo-specific
                                “genres.” For instance, these nascent genres include a trend toward visual art or concretism - automating the 
                                generation of ASCII art - and a kind of procedurally-generated narratives wherein a program simulates a series 
                                of circumstances and then attempts to describe the experience of travelling through them. These “genres” are 
                                notable not only because they create unique work, but also because they aid in visualizing the process through 
                                which programs create work, one which differs fundamentally from that of traditional human authors.

                                As digital technology occupies or gives shape to every facet of our daily lives, it is inevitable that computers 
                                will be part of how we imagine our future and think about the world around us. Computer-generated fiction offers 
                                us many ways to conceptualize the creative potentials of artificial intelligence, experiment with avant-garde 
                                poetics, and imagine the futures of literature in the 21st century.
